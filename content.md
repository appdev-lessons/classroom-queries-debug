# Classroom Queries Debug

In this project, we'll practice `ActiveRecord` queries and GUI forms so our user's can create, read, update, and delete.

We'll do that with a small classroom domain model by debugging some Rails starter code. Here is our domain model:

Here is our target: [classroom-queries-debug.matchthetarget.com](https://classroom-queries-debug.matchthetarget.com/)

Load the assignment:

LTI{Load Classroom Queries Debug assignment}(https://grades.firstdraft.com/launch)[S9ymPy6WCsn18gLbByVbZQ7k]{vfdtzJb5bLYqYwuqgeRKpc5d}(10)[Classroom Queries Debug Project]

Then, fork the repository and create your Codespace. Start your live app preview with `bin/dev` once the Codespace is setup.

You should keep the [Contact Book `ActiveRecord` reading handy](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/130-contact-book-first-database); it's a good reference. You can also look back at your Must See Movies Queries and GUI projects to see how you queried and built forms there.

When you are ready to get automated feedback run `rake grade`. Before you run `rake grade` you should try and manually match the target; don't rely on `rake grade` to debug; **the better errors page is going to be much more helpful for debugging your starter code.**
